Selecting the best suited environment is crucial for each trial.
The synthesis of environments leaves traces of further compatible environments. These traces can be seen on the microscope.


-	Triangular Environments 
  - Usually respond well with circular environments

-	Circular Environments
  - Respond well with pentagonal and hexagonal environments

-	Square Environments
  - Respond well with dot environments

-	Dot Environments
  - Cannot be pre-configured. They can only the result of a synthesis. To receive the best chance for a dot environment outcome, please use configuration in the trial, a configuration is available

-	Hexagonal Environments
  - Respond well with pentagonal and circular environments

-	Pentagonal Environments
  - Respond well with circular and pentagonal environments

To configure the analysis for a particular experiment please use the corresponding environment codes.

- Triangular 024
- Circular 016
- Square 011
- Dot 000
- Hexagonal 019
- Pentagonal 005
