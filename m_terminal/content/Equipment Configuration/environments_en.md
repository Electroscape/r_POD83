Selecting the best suited environment is crucial for each trial.

The synthesis of environments leaves traces of further compatible environments. These traces can be seen under the
microscope.

- Triangular Environments
    - Usually respond well with circular environments

- Circular Environments
    - Respond well with pentagonial and hexagonial environments

- Square Environments
    - Respond well with dot environments

- Dot Environments
    - Cannot be pre-configured. They can only be the result of a synthesis. To receive the best chance for a dot
      environment outcome, please useâ€¦

- Hexagonial Environments
    - Respond well with pentagonial and circular environments

- Pentagonial Environments
    - Respond well with circular and pentagonial environments

To configure the analysis for a particular experiment please use the corresponding environment codes.
